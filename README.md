App Component:
The code begins with importing the necessary dependencies and components.

The App component is defined as a functional component that represents the main entry point of the application.

Inside the App component, three state variables are declared using the useState hook:

color: Stores the current value of the color entered by the user.
error: Tracks whether an error occurred during color parsing.
list: Maintains an array of color objects generated from the input color.
The handleSubmit function is defined to handle the form submission event. It prevents the default form submission behavior and attempts to generate a list of color shades based on the user input. If an error occurs during color parsing, it sets the error state to true and logs the error to the console.

The return statement contains the JSX code to render the application:

The UI is divided into two sections using the <section> element.
In the first section with the class name "container," there is a heading "color generator" and a form. The form consists of an input field for the color value, which is bound to the color state variable. The input's value is updated by the onChange event handler, which sets the color state with the entered value. The input field can display an error state by adding the "error" class conditionally based on the error state. The form is submitted by clicking the "submit" button or pressing Enter, which triggers the handleSubmit function.
In the second section with the class name "colors," a list of color shades is rendered. It uses the list state, which is an array of color objects. Each color object is passed as props to the SingleColor component, which is imported from a separate file. The map function is used to iterate over the list array and render individual SingleColor components.
Finally, the App component is exported as the default export.

SingleColor Component:
The SingleColor component is another functional component that represents an individual color shade.

Inside the SingleColor component, several state variables are declared using the useState hook:

alert: Tracks whether the copy-to-clipboard action has been triggered.
bcg: A string representation of the RGB values joined by commas.
hex: The hexadecimal representation of the RGB values.
hexValue: The complete hex color value, including the "#" symbol.
The useEffect hook is used to set a timeout for clearing the alert state after 3 seconds. This triggers the removal of the "copied to clipboard" message. The useEffect hook runs only when the alert state changes.

The return statement contains the JSX code to render an individual color shade:

An <article> element is rendered with the class "color." If the index prop is greater than 10, an additional class "color-light" is added. The index prop represents the index of the color in the list.
The background color of the article is set dynamically based on the bcg variable, which holds the RGB values.
An onClick event handler is attached to the article. When clicked, it sets the alert state to true and copies the hexValue to the clipboard using the navigator.clipboard.writeText method.
Inside the article, there are three paragraphs:
The first paragraph displays the weight percentage of the color shade.
The second paragraph displays the hexValue, representing the hexadecimal color code.
The third paragraph with the class "alert" is conditionally rendered when the alert state is true, indicating that the color has been copied to the clipboard.
Finally, the SingleColor component is exported as the default export.

Utility Functions:
The componentToHex function takes an integer value c and converts it to a two-digit hexadecimal representation. If the resulting hex value has only one digit, it prefixes it with a '0' to ensure it is a two-digit value.

The rgbToHex function takes three parameters, r, g, and b, representing the red, green, and blue values of a color, respectively. It uses the componentToHex function to convert each RGB component to hexadecimal and concatenates them to form the complete hexadecimal color code.

Both utility functions are exported as default exports.
